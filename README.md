# Product Designer Automated Configuration Tool

There are two main goals for this project right now:

1. Pull the existing configuration from product designer and store in a text file (json or yaml)
2. Be able to apply changes made to the config files.

## Uses

* Python 3.7 (package manager install)
* Selenium (pipenv install)
* Chromium/Chrome WebDriver (package manager install)

--Dev

* powerline-status (this is personal for my vim config)
